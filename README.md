Popular Movies, Stage1
======================

I'm participating in the Udacity+Google Android Nanodegree program.
And this is the Popular Movies, Stage1 assignment.


## Description

This app provides ability to discover Popular and Highly-Rated movies.
When the app is launched, it will fetch and display relevant movie data.
This is a stepping-stone for the "Popular Movies, Stage2" app.

This app uses API and data from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to retrieve movies.
You need to provide your own API key in order to run the app.  Place your API key into TmdbApiKeyHolder.java
